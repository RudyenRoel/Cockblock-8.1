Here are the instructions for a single-device game

	Introduction
You play the game with two players, one on the top and one on the bottom of the screen.
The goal of the game is to deplete your opponent's life.
This is done by breaking through the Shields of your opponent by shooting with your cannons. Every hit will do your enemy permanent damage, IF they fail to block the shot! When their health is 0, you win the match.
Both teams have 3 "ShieldCannon"'s. They will be cannons during your turn and shields when it's your opponents turn.
Every ShieldCannon has 100 energy at the start of a game (You can never have more then 100). Shooting costs energy, but so does defending! Try to match a nice number of shots with very precise defending to master this game.

Health is displayed as a the red bar with the amount of health displayed inside, on top and the bottom of the screen.
On the sides of the screen you will find 2 blue bars. These represent the remaining time there is to shoot.
The energy of the ShieldCannon will be displayed below the ShieldCannon.
For an example of the energy/health bars, press button SG1.

To get an idea of what the gameplay looks like, press button SG2.
