Here are the instructions for the single game

	Introduction
You play the game with two teams, one on the top, and one on the bottem of the screen.
The purpose of this game is to defeat your enemy and get the highest score.
This by breaking through the Shields you can attack your enemy. Every hit will do your enemy permanent damage. When his health reached 0, you win the match.
Both teams have 3 'Shield-Cannon's. When you attack, they will be cannons and when you defende they will be shields.
Every ShieldCannon has at the start of the game 100 energy (You can't have more then 100).

The Health of you and your enemy is displayed in the red bar on top and the bottom of the screen.
On the sides of the schreen you find 2 blue colored bars. These represent the remaining time to shoot.
